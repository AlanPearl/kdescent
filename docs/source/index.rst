Welcome to kdescent's documentation!
====================================

kdescent provides a general framework for comparing an N-dimensional
distribution of a model population to that of a training dataset. It allows you
to perform stochastic gradient descent over mini-batched KDE statistics. The
code is open-source and available on `GitHub <https://github.com/AlanPearl/kdescent>`__.
